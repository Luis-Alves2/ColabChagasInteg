# ColabChagasInteg
Chagas Disease(CD) deaths analysis.

This project was developed downloading the obituary of brazilians, through DATASUS, who passed due to Chagas Disease during the years of 2012 - 2022. Then some comparisons were made using the original cause of death, the state in which each death happened and the creation of some graphics using seaborn and matplotlib to analyze which causes were more prevalent in which brazilian region.

To create a similar CSV to the one used, please refer to the notebook called "Mortalidade Chagas - Download.ipynb", otherwise if youd like to add some analysis of your own, please refer to the notebook : "chagas_Estudo_Para_Apresentação"
